I'm Wen Yifan,

03:26.360 --> 03:27.380
Wen Ming's cousin.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.570
I've learned a bit

03:46.870 --> 03:48.220
about your situation.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.340
I've been through

03:53.630 --> 03:54.540
the same thing.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.170
Back then, I dragged him

04:05.190 --> 04:06.380
and jumped off the balcony together.

04:08.680 --> 04:09.980
At that moment,

04:10.840 --> 04:12.100
I thought maybe dying wasn't so bad.

But later, I realized

04:15.710 --> 04:17.020
dying with someone like him

14:10.440 --> 14:11.300
Maybe...

14:11.320 --> 14:12.460
maybe I'm overthinking.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.580
But I'm worried he might come after you.

14:15.790 --> 14:17.490
Be extra careful when you go out,

14:17.510 --> 14:18.130
okay?

14:18.630 --> 14:20.130
This time, you went to Beiyu

14:20.750 --> 14:21.610
just for this?

14:23.870 --> 14:24.650
Why are you

14:24.670 --> 14:26.580
always worrying about me, a grown man?

14:27.030 --> 14:28.060
Wen Shuangjiang,

14:28.870 --> 14:30.490
you're the one who needs

14:32.510 --> 14:33.250
to be careful.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.300
And also,

14:37.510 --> 14:39.100
make sure to listen

14:39.120 --> 14:39.730
to that recording pen.

14:42.910 --> 14:44.370
With you here in person,

14:44.720 --> 14:46.060
why should I bother with a recording?

14:46.240 --> 14:48.460
Saying some things out loud

14:48.630 --> 14:49.820
just feels too cheesy.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.250
Oh, right.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.220
Today,

14:56.630 --> 14:57.340
I ran into

14:57.360 --> 14:58.890
a policewoman I used to know.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.340
Remember when I reported it back then?

15:02.960 --> 15:04.580
After I moved out of my Uncle Wen's house,

15:05.080 --> 15:06.940
she took me in for a while.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.980
Seeing her today made me happy.

15:11.270 --> 15:12.180
It brought back a lot of feelings.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.250
She was really good to me.

15:15.270 --> 15:16.940
Her daughter, Chen Xi, was too.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.730
Next time we get a chance,

15:19.720 --> 15:21.100
let's visit her together.

15:21.150 --> 15:21.770
Sure.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.940
What about when Chen Xi gets married?

15:27.080 --> 15:27.820
Let's go together.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.890
I saw on her social media

15:30.150 --> 15:31.820
that her boyfriend proposed.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.820
I'm not sure when exactly the wedding will be.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.700
We'll see if you're free when the time comes.

15:41.390 --> 15:42.730
Wen Shuangjiang,

15:44.360 --> 15:45.250
are you hinting at something?

15:46.120 --> 15:46.770
What?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.890
Your birthday's coming up, isn't it?

15:51.480 --> 15:52.650
Make sure to wish

15:53.670 --> 15:54.730
for something good this year.

15:55.670 --> 15:56.300
And I,

15:56.320 --> 15:56.980
as always,

15:58.150 --> 15:58.980
will make it happen.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.370
I'll hang up now.

16:01.960 --> 16:02.490
All right.

16:02.510 --> 16:04.370
If you're tired, get some rest.

16:04.960 --> 16:05.460
Goodnight.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.770
Coming.

16:51.160 --> 16:51.890
Hello, Mr. Guo.

16:53.030 --> 16:54.420
Who are you looking for?

16:55.360 --> 16:56.890
I'm a friend of Guo Ling.

16:57.960 --> 16:58.940
I want to visit her.

17:01.510 --> 17:02.220
Please come in.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.490
I'm a reporter from Nanwu TV.

17:37.830 --> 17:38.980
But don't worry,

17:39.400 --> 17:40.530
I won't interview you.

17:42.960 --> 17:43.620
Have a seat.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.460
When Ling was three,

18:01.440 --> 18:02.700
her mother passed away.

18:04.830 --> 18:06.380
I was busy running my stall,
(Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

18:07.240 --> 18:08.140
up early and home late,

18:08.160 --> 18:09.010
barely having time for her.

18:10.270 --> 18:11.140
She was always

18:11.400 --> 18:12.460
a well-behaved,

18:12.480 --> 18:13.420
quiet child.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.730
She would often hide away in her room,

18:15.750 --> 18:16.620
writing things on her own.

18:17.550 --> 18:18.700
But I never encouraged her.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.730
I always thought the things she wrote about,

18:21.960 --> 18:23.050
romance, dreams...

18:23.640 --> 18:24.860
were just unrealistic.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.420
That night,

18:29.310 --> 18:30.730
we had an argument.

18:32.030 --> 18:33.730
It was the first time she ever talked back to me.

18:35.350 --> 18:36.140
I never thought...

18:39.920 --> 18:41.460
it'd be the last.

18:43.160 --> 18:43.770
Ling.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.140
Why are you just sitting there?

18:46.160 --> 18:47.180
Come help me

18:47.330 --> 18:48.890
sort things for tomorrow's stall.

18:51.590 --> 18:52.140
Dad,

18:52.590 --> 18:53.700
look at what I wrote!

18:54.030 --> 18:55.530
I really love writing.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.250
I want to get published.

18:57.830 --> 18:58.460
I don't want to see it.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.460
Who's going to read

19:00.480 --> 19:01.770
that worthless nonsense?

19:02.440 --> 19:03.730
Dad, don't say that.

19:04.750 --> 19:05.490
My dream

19:05.510 --> 19:07.050
is to become a bestselling author!

19:07.070 --> 19:07.980
I have a dream, too!

19:09.270 --> 19:10.180
My dream

19:11.070 --> 19:12.460
is figuring out how to make money

19:12.640 --> 19:14.330
so I can put food on the table.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.600
But I can't just spend

19:17.030 --> 19:18.250
my whole life

19:18.270 --> 19:19.290
selling goods with you outside.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.940
I have my own dreams.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.420
What's wrong with selling things?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.250
Does it embarrass you?

19:29.440 --> 19:31.220
Writing novels can make money, too.

19:32.510 --> 19:33.290
You?

19:33.790 --> 19:34.810
Make money from writing?

19:35.240 --> 19:35.810
Let me see.

19:37.240 --> 19:37.860
Where's the money?

19:37.880 --> 19:39.330
Money? Where is it?

19:41.440 --> 19:42.380
If you're not helping, just go to bed!

19:42.960 --> 19:43.730
Unbelievable!

19:49.200 --> 19:50.420
I never thought...

19:51.590 --> 19:53.460
after she said those words,

19:54.160 --> 19:55.940
she'd never come back.

19:58.030 --> 19:58.860
All these years,

20:00.440 --> 20:02.220
I thought she was mad at me,

20:03.070 --> 20:04.460
hiding away, writing,

20:04.480 --> 20:06.090
refusing to come home.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.140
Tell me...

20:09.200 --> 20:10.420
If back then,

20:10.550 --> 20:11.420
I had cared just a little more,

20:11.680 --> 20:13.770
maybe she wouldn't have run away.

20:14.590 --> 20:15.700
Maybe by now,

20:17.960 --> 20:18.810
she really would've

20:19.270 --> 20:20.940
made a name for herself

20:21.830 --> 20:24.330
and become the author she always dreamed of being.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.770
I should've been the father she relied on.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.250
But...

20:35.160 --> 20:38.050
I was the one who led her to that monster.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.660
I deserve to die.

20:42.550 --> 20:43.330
I deserve to die!

20:43.350 --> 20:44.400
Mr. Guo, stop!

20:44.880 --> 20:45.860
This isn't your fault.

20:46.790 --> 20:47.490
Calm down.

20:48.590 --> 20:50.730
She let her guard down

20:50.830 --> 20:53.250
because he was the neighbor.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.380
Don't worry.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.570
Once the verdict is out, I'll report it as it is.

20:59.590 --> 21:00.700
I just hope no one else

21:00.720 --> 21:01.940
goes through the same thing.

21:03.160 --> 21:03.860
Thank you.

21:05.750 --> 21:06.460
Thank you.

21:18.580 --> 21:18.960
Hello?

21:19.310 --> 21:19.940
What's the situation?

21:20.750 --> 21:22.090
Che Xingde is still on the run.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.570
But Che Yanqin

21:23.790 --> 21:25.180
has been detained, I think.

21:25.750 --> 21:26.460
Are you coming back to Nanwu?

21:27.480 --> 21:28.290
When will you be back?

21:28.310 --> 21:29.290
We're planning to head back soon.

21:29.550 --> 21:31.460
But I just got a call.

21:31.830 --> 21:33.770
They want me at the police station

21:33.790 --> 21:34.620
to assist with the investigation.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.570
Also...

21:36.480 --> 21:37.530
Che Xingde

21:37.960 --> 21:39.010
might be back in Nanwu.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.700
Be extra careful when you go out,

21:40.720 --> 21:41.290
okay?

21:41.510 --> 21:42.490
You're the one who should be careful.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.460
I'll be waiting for you at home.

21:54.020 --> 22:13.860
[Tea]

22:23.880 --> 22:24.570
Did you see that?

22:24.590 --> 22:25.140
Yifan,

22:25.440 --> 22:26.290
I sent you the files.

22:26.310 --> 22:27.010
I'm heading out.

22:27.030 --> 22:27.570
All right, take care.

22:27.590 --> 22:28.220
Bye.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.090
I'm leaving now, Yifan.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.140
Just swap

22:31.160 --> 22:32.770
those two around.

22:32.790 --> 22:33.900
See? Super simple.

22:33.920 --> 22:34.730
Got it?

22:35.550 --> 22:36.460
All right, finish up and head home.

22:36.480 --> 22:36.980
Thanks.

22:37.160 --> 22:37.810
Bye.

22:42.920 --> 22:43.570
Yifan,

22:44.070 --> 22:44.700
why hasn't

22:45.200 --> 22:46.420
that relative of yours

22:46.440 --> 22:47.250
been reported?

22:50.160 --> 22:51.810
The police are still investigating.

22:52.030 --> 22:53.090
We're waiting for the confirmed results.

22:54.550 --> 22:55.810
Hope they can bring that villain

22:55.830 --> 22:56.490
to justice soon.

22:57.200 --> 22:57.900
I hope so, too.

22:58.880 --> 22:59.460
All right,

22:59.680 --> 23:00.490
I'll get going.

23:00.750 --> 23:01.620
You should head home soon, too.

23:01.830 --> 23:02.700
Stay safe.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.490
[Sang Yan]
Let me know when you're done working.

23:11.790 --> 23:12.810
I'll come pick you up.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.140
[Wen Yifan]
Okay. Come at 8:30.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.090
If I ever hit rock bottom,

24:10.640 --> 24:11.570
no matter where you go,

24:11.590 --> 24:12.900
I'll always find you.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.290
I'm not feeling great today.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.460
I think I'll just head home.

24:39.050 --> 24:40.450
Lower the overall saturation

24:40.670 --> 24:41.420
a bit more.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.700
And then, these two characters...

24:42.720 --> 24:43.460
- Sang Yan. - ...should be enlarged.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.140
Going or not?

24:45.160 --> 24:45.770
These two?

24:45.790 --> 24:46.810
To Overtime.

24:47.000 --> 24:47.570
I'm not going.

24:50.310 --> 24:51.290
Right.

24:51.750 --> 24:52.250
Right here.

24:52.270 --> 24:52.860
Okay.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.090
Does this part need any adjustments?

24:56.960 --> 24:57.620
Bro.

24:58.030 --> 24:58.900
Why aren't you going again?

25:01.880 --> 25:03.380
I've got to pick up my girlfriend from work.

25:06.070 --> 25:07.090
You two can't stand

25:07.350 --> 25:08.810
even a little time apart, huh?

25:08.830 --> 25:09.460
Right?

25:10.720 --> 25:11.460
When are you free?

25:11.720 --> 25:12.700
Let's get together for a hot pot.

25:12.920 --> 25:13.770
It has been ages since we hung out.

25:14.590 --> 25:15.380
With who?

25:16.720 --> 25:18.180
A bunch of couples.

25:19.790 --> 25:20.420
Sure.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.290
Wait for me.

25:32.590 --> 25:33.730
I'm wrapping up here.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.010
Come pick me up now.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.900
[Okay]

26:32.790 --> 26:34.180
Che Xingde is still on the run.

26:34.510 --> 26:35.660
But Che Yanqin

26:36.030 --> 26:37.490
has been detained, I think.

26:38.110 --> 26:38.730
Also...

26:39.720 --> 26:40.700
Che Xingde

26:41.030 --> 26:42.010
might be back in Nanwu.

26:55.750 --> 26:56.700
Hello, I'd like to report a crime.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.250
I'm at the entrance of Nanwu TV station.

27:00.270 --> 27:01.620
I spotted the suspect, Che Xingde.

27:02.400 --> 27:02.860
Yes.

27:20.310 --> 27:21.250
He's been

27:21.550 --> 27:22.380
harassing me nonstop.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.380
Luckily, they came home early.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.380
What are you doing here?

27:51.590 --> 27:52.250
None of your business!

27:52.270 --> 27:52.940
Let go of me.

27:53.310 --> 27:53.940
Let go!

28:11.350 --> 28:12.570
Tired from running all this time?

28:13.830 --> 28:15.570
Wouldn't it be easier to sit back and enjoy your time in prison?

28:18.200 --> 28:19.140
Why don't you try it yourself?

29:14.550 --> 29:15.810
Why weren't you answering your phone?

29:26.540 --> 29:26.920
Hello?

29:26.920 --> 29:27.370
Hello?

29:27.880 --> 29:28.660
Who's this?

29:28.790 --> 29:29.940
I just found this phone.

29:29.960 --> 29:30.660
The owner

29:30.680 --> 29:31.860
got stabbed in a fight.

29:31.880 --> 29:32.420
What?

29:32.960 --> 29:33.700
Where are you guys?

30:08.720 --> 30:09.420
Here!

30:10.110 --> 30:10.810
I'm here!

30:12.110 --> 30:12.770
Here!

30:13.240 --> 30:14.380
Were you the one who answered the phone?

30:14.400 --> 30:14.900
Yeah.

30:14.920 --> 30:15.700
Where is he now?

30:16.240 --> 30:17.220
He just got taken to the hospital.

30:17.750 --> 30:18.900
Are you his girlfriend?

30:20.270 --> 30:21.770
Is his name Sang Yan?

30:22.070 --> 30:23.220
I don't know.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.010
I just saw a tall, skinny guy.

30:25.510 --> 30:27.140
His hands were covered in blood.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.620
His stomach got slashed, too.

30:28.920 --> 30:29.980
The blood just kept flowing.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.380
That much blood...

30:32.160 --> 30:33.090
Did the medics say anything?

30:33.110 --> 30:34.090
He was taken

30:34.110 --> 30:35.220
to Nanwu Central Hospital.

30:35.240 --> 30:35.770
Thank you.

30:35.960 --> 30:36.620
His phone!

30:40.550 --> 30:41.090
Thanks.

30:41.110 --> 30:41.770
Hurry!

31:22.880 --> 31:23.700
It'll be okay...

31:24.160 --> 31:24.730
It'll be okay...

31:27.550 --> 31:28.090
I love you.

31:29.830 --> 31:30.770
So, so much.

31:34.880 --> 31:35.460
Do you understand?

31:47.550 --> 31:49.180
Can you go any faster?

31:49.960 --> 31:50.420
See?

31:50.440 --> 31:51.250
So much traffic.

31:59.270 --> 32:00.380
Miss, are you all right?

32:17.750 --> 32:19.250
Wen Shuangjiang.

32:20.270 --> 32:21.490
Stay safe at work.

32:22.030 --> 32:23.010
Your man

32:23.160 --> 32:25.570
wants you home safe.

32:28.790 --> 32:30.220
Wen Shuangjiang.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.490
Stay safe at work.

32:32.960 --> 32:33.940
Your man

32:34.070 --> 32:36.490
wants you home safe.

32:43.030 --> 32:43.700
Sir,

32:44.350 --> 32:45.530
is there another route we can take?

32:46.110 --> 32:46.810
Nope.

32:46.830 --> 32:48.250
What's going on today?

32:48.400 --> 32:49.420
Traffic's a total mess.

32:51.030 --> 32:52.140

33:00.720 --> 33:01.200
Hello?

33:04.680 --> 33:05.810
Is that you, Sang Yan?

33:06.790 --> 33:07.460
Wen Shuangjiang...

33:07.960 --> 33:09.380
Are you okay? Where are you hurt?

33:09.720 --> 33:10.900
I'm fine.

33:11.070 --> 33:12.460
Just a small cut on my hand.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.250
You call that fine?

33:13.270 --> 33:14.700
I saw so much blood.

33:15.030 --> 33:16.980
Most of it was probably Che Xingde's.

33:17.790 --> 33:18.770
I swear. I'm okay.

33:19.030 --> 33:20.000
Don't worry so much.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.340
I already told you. I'm fine.

33:22.270 --> 33:23.380
I'll head home myself later.

33:23.830 --> 33:25.570
I still need to make a statement here.

33:25.680 --> 33:26.530
It might take some time.

33:26.590 --> 33:27.980
Where are you now? I'll come to you.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.620
I'm at...

33:29.640 --> 33:30.490
Central Hospital's emergency room.

33:31.000 --> 33:31.570
Got it.

33:35.510 --> 33:36.090
Sir.

33:36.110 --> 33:36.620
Thank you.

33:37.440 --> 33:38.250
Okay, Mr. Sang.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.490
Once you're done with treatment,

33:39.720 --> 33:40.940
we'll come back to check in with you.

33:41.110 --> 33:41.940
All right. Thank you.

33:59.830 --> 34:00.530
Excuse me.

34:00.920 --> 34:01.730
Is there a patient

34:02.000 --> 34:03.530
named Sang Yan here?

34:03.880 --> 34:04.530
Over there.

34:05.110 --> 34:05.660
Thank you.

34:05.830 --> 34:06.420
No problem.

34:21.670 --> 34:23.130
Besides the eight stitches on your hand,

34:23.280 --> 34:24.260
is your stomach wound all right?

34:25.440 --> 34:26.090
It's fine now.

34:26.230 --> 34:26.980
Okay then.

34:27.110 --> 34:28.340
If there's any update,

34:28.440 --> 34:29.300
let us know.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.490
Got it. Thanks.

34:43.590 --> 34:44.530
Just a small cut?

34:50.230 --> 34:51.010
A small cut needed eight stitches?

34:53.400 --> 34:54.210
Well...

34:54.230 --> 34:55.570
not only do you not care about me,

34:55.630 --> 34:56.610
but you're actually mad at me?

34:57.670 --> 34:58.860
Why did you go after him?

34:59.400 --> 35:00.130
What?

35:00.150 --> 35:01.130
Did I do something wrong?

35:01.230 --> 35:01.900
When you saw him,

35:01.920 --> 35:03.460
why didn't you just call the police?

35:04.920 --> 35:05.860
What if he ran away?

35:05.920 --> 35:07.050
Do you always have to play the hero?

35:18.440 --> 35:19.420
What's wrong with you?

35:22.190 --> 35:23.380
I don't like you doing this.

35:23.630 --> 35:25.170
Can you just stay out of this?

35:25.190 --> 35:26.820
Don't make me regret telling you this, okay?

35:27.150 --> 35:28.050
Go to work.

35:28.070 --> 35:28.740
Come home.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.170
Just be safe. Is that so hard?

35:30.190 --> 35:32.170
I don't even care about this anymore.

35:32.190 --> 35:33.340
Even if I want Che Xingde

35:33.360 --> 35:34.570
to rot in prison forever,

35:35.440 --> 35:36.420
that thought...

35:37.320 --> 35:39.090
doesn't compare to my fear of losing you!

35:55.550 --> 35:56.490
Why aren't you happy?

35:59.710 --> 36:00.940
Che Xingde was caught.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.650
Your aunt paid the price.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.170
That girl finally got justice.

36:09.880 --> 36:10.570
And...

36:14.440 --> 36:15.130
this time,

36:16.070 --> 36:16.940
I protected you.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.010
I actually care a lot.

36:23.030 --> 36:23.900
I care so much.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.940
Back then, when I said I wouldn't chase after you,

36:24.960 --> 36:26.050
I really meant it.

36:27.480 --> 36:28.210
But now I think...

36:30.440 --> 36:31.340
why does a man like me

36:31.360 --> 36:32.570
care so much about pride?

36:36.440 --> 36:37.570
Why did I

36:39.360 --> 36:41.250
hold this grudge for so many years?

36:50.710 --> 36:52.250
Back then, young and reckless,

36:54.150 --> 36:55.020
loving someone

36:55.960 --> 36:57.340
meant giving you everything,

36:59.590 --> 37:00.940
and lowering my pride over and over.

37:02.080 --> 37:02.770
But...

37:03.400 --> 37:05.130
but at the same time,

37:07.150 --> 37:08.420
your words could tear me apart so easily.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.540
I told myself,

37:12.630 --> 37:13.250
for the rest of my life,

37:13.270 --> 37:14.610
I would never step into your world again.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.900
But I knew I was lying.

37:20.270 --> 37:22.130
I knew all I could do was wait, hopelessly.

37:22.310 --> 37:23.770
Still, for the sake of dignity,

37:23.790 --> 37:25.170
for the sake of saving face,

37:27.270 --> 37:28.060
I thought...

37:33.710 --> 37:34.650
I could never be the one

37:34.670 --> 37:35.540
to reach out first again.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.940
But now, I regret it.

37:37.150 --> 37:38.940
I regret spending two whole years

37:38.960 --> 37:40.500
only thinking about

37:41.710 --> 37:43.340
how I was the weaker one in this relationship.

37:48.110 --> 37:50.210
Yet, not once did I try to pull you out of it.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.940
I never even noticed the pain and despair

37:56.960 --> 37:58.900
you kept buried so deep.

38:01.590 --> 38:02.250
Stop.

38:02.270 --> 38:03.940
This was my fault.

38:03.960 --> 38:04.940
It's not on you.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.900
The only one to blame is that villain, Che Xingde.

38:09.000 --> 38:09.940
So, Wen Shuangjiang,

38:10.630 --> 38:11.690
I did it this time.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.060
Can you be happy for me?

38:14.400 --> 38:15.940
I put that villain behind bars.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.090
Can you stop crying now?

38:39.630 --> 38:42.020
Come on, I'm the one in pain from the stitches.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.820
Why are you crying so much?

38:47.520 --> 38:48.210
What are you doing?

38:51.440 --> 38:52.340
If you keep crying,

38:52.400 --> 38:53.170
I'll...

38:54.360 --> 38:55.170
Take care.

38:57.520 --> 38:58.820
Don't you feel bad for me?

39:01.000 --> 39:02.210
All right. I'm fine now.

39:03.670 --> 39:04.730
It doesn't hurt at all.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.090
Wen Shuangjiang,

39:07.110 --> 39:08.020
what's with you?

39:11.040 --> 39:12.060
Weren't you

39:12.790 --> 39:13.770
covering this news?

39:13.920 --> 39:15.290
How could I be in the mood for that?

39:15.400 --> 39:16.940
When my house burned down,

39:17.080 --> 39:18.860
you were eager to report on it.

39:19.110 --> 39:20.210
That was different.

39:21.710 --> 39:23.210
All right. It's over now. Let's go.

39:23.230 --> 39:24.210
Take care.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.060
I'm really fine. Just a few scratches.

39:27.630 --> 39:28.420
Are you okay?

39:29.040 --> 39:30.380
Take this jacket for me.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.980
Even injured, you're still so talkative.

39:35.080 --> 39:35.860
Are you okay?

39:36.110 --> 39:36.900
Okay.

39:38.040 --> 39:38.900
What else can I do?

39:39.710 --> 39:40.650
